    "A Bayesian network, Bayes network, belief network, Bayes(ian) model or probabilistic directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model (a type of statistical model) that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Bayesian networks are mostly used when we want to represent causal relationship between the random variables. Bayesian Networks are parameterized using Conditional Probability Distributions (CPD). Each node in the network is parameterized using $ P(node | Pa(node)) $ where $ Pa(node) $ represents the parents of node in the network.\n",

One other possible case can be when $ B $ is observed i.e. we know the value of $ B $. So, in this case any change in $ A $ won't affect $ B $ since we already know the value. And hence there won't be any change in $ C $ as it depends only on $ B $. Mathematically  we can say that: $ (A \\perp C | B) $.\n",

Let's take the example of $ D \\rightarrow G \\leftarrow I $. In this case if we increase the difficulty of the course the probability of getting a higher grade reduces but this has no effect on the intelligence of the student. But when $ B $ is observed let's say that the student got a good grade. Now if we increase the difficulty of the course this will increase the probability of the student to be intelligent since we already know that he got a good grade.
