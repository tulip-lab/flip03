Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs and using that to make predictions or decisions, rather than following strictly static program instructions.\n",

Support vector machine tries to find a plane which separates the data points. Decision Tree tries to find a set of simple greater than and less than equations to classify the data. Let's try to apply Decision Tree on this data set.\n",

For example, for 10 random variables each having 10 states, the size of the Joint Distribution would be 10^10."
